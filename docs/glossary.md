# Glossary

## Core causality terms

### Retrocausality (forbidden in this framework)
Physical causal influence from a future event to a past event.

### Epistemic retro-influence (allowed)
Present behavior changes because agents anticipate future inference or future evaluation, without any backward physical causal channel.

### Retrodictive transparency
Condition where future observers can infer past states/actions with high fidelity from later observables.

### Causality-safe informational closure
A temporally distributed strategic loop where all physical causation remains forward, but agents coordinate across expected inference capabilities.

## Tempo Tracer protocol terms

### Mode A (Direct Light Path)
Conventional line-of-sight signaling with light-speed constraints.

### Mode B (Shared Medium)
Both sides encode/decode through a common geometric medium (e.g., curved-spacetime channel) with potentially asymmetric latency/fidelity.

### Mode C (Archival / Beacon)
Structured signatures designed for delayed decoding from persistent outside-horizon observables.

### Data plane
Payload transport layer.

### Timing plane
Cross-frame temporal alignment layer (e.g., $t$, $\tau$, $\sigma$).

### Trust plane
Integrity and uncertainty metadata (checksum, confidence, validity window).

## Observer and agency terms

### Read-write observer effect
Observation both extracts and perturbs structure through measurement policy and feedback.

### Observer state $S_t$
Priors, memory, attention, self-model, and current interpretive stance of the observer.

### Latent state $L_t$
Underlying state not directly observed (or only partially observed).

### Anticipatory policy coupling
Policy updates driven by expected future inference/evaluation under present information.

### Agency (operational)
Capacity to choose policy, evaluate outcomes, and update policy under internal objectives.

## Governance terms

### Claim tiers
Separation of statements into defensible, plausible-but-unproven, and speculative.

### Falsification-first
A claim is acceptable only if measurable failure conditions are pre-defined and testable.

### Autonomy preservation
Constraint that performance gains must not come from hidden coercion or systematic erosion of user-directed revision.
