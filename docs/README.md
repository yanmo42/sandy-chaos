# Sandy Chaos Documentation

This documentation set is intentionally compressed into a small canonical path:

1. **[01 Foundations](01_foundations.md)**
2. **[02 Tempo Tracer Protocol](02_tempo_tracer_protocol.md)**
3. **[03 Micro-Observer & Agency](03_micro_observer_agency.md)**
4. **[04 Neuro Roadmap](04_neuro_roadmap.md)**

Supporting references:

- **[Glossary](glossary.md)**
- **[Math Appendix](math_appendix.md)**

Legacy long-form drafts are preserved under **[archive/](archive/README.md)**.

## Suggested reading paths

### Fast path (15–20 min)

- Foundations → Protocol → Glossary

### Research path (full)

- Foundations → Protocol → Micro-Observer → Neuro Roadmap → Math Appendix

### Philosophy-first path

- Foundations → Micro-Observer → Neuro Roadmap

## Writing policy

To keep the material readable while preserving rigor:

- Core docs use **plain-language claims first**.
- Math is used **selectively** when it clarifies structure or falsifiability.
- Derivation-heavy material belongs in the **Math Appendix**.
- Every major claim should include a **failure condition**.
