# Archive: Legacy Long-Form Drafts

This folder preserves earlier documentation drafts that contained valuable detail but substantial overlap.

These files are retained for historical context and source material, while the active canonical docs now live at the top level of `docs/`:

1. `01_foundations.md`
2. `02_tempo_tracer_protocol.md`
3. `03_micro_observer_agency.md`
4. `04_neuro_roadmap.md`

Supporting references:

- `glossary.md`
- `math_appendix.md`

If content from this archive is reused, prefer extracting it into the canonical docs in compressed form (claim → rationale → minimal formalism → falsification).
